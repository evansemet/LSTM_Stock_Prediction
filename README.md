# LSTM_Stock_Prediction
LSTM model to predict future stock prices

Used a Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) Artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict future stock prices.

Assumptions that this model takes:
1. Previous prices (and patterns) are an indication of future prices
2. Overall market conditions have not changed

Ways to improve this model:
1. Incorporate factors outside of market price data such as leading economic indicators
2. Backtest the model in specific segments with similar market conditions
