# LSTM_Stock_Prediction
LSTM model to predict future stock prices

Used a Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) Artificial Reccurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict future stock prices.

This model takes on a whole host of assumptions, but the biggest one being that future prices can be predicted by previous prices and patterns (AKA technical analysis). Technical analysis is promoted by tons of stock 'gurus' and influencers on social media touting that spotting simple patterns are a surefire 'get rich quick' method. The outcome of this model should further prove that technical analysis- at least on its own- is not a reliable method for predicting future movements in stocks.
